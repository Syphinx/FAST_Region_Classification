# Focus Assessment with Sonography for Trauma (FAST) Procedure Classifier

## Overview

The Focus Assessment with Sonography for Trauma (FAST) procedure is a crucial ultrasound examination tool used to identify peritoneal traumatic free fluid in specific body regions, including the Left Upper Quadrant, Right Upper Quadrant, Pericardium, and Pelvic region. While invaluable in clinical settings, it has limitations in assessing the skill level of users.

This project addresses these challenges by developing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture aimed at classifying regions from a FAST scan, forming the basis for an automated skills assessment pipeline.

## Objectives

- **Region Classification:** Develop a CNN for region classification of data obtained from a FAST scan.
- **Skills Assessment:** Enable the creation of an automated skills assessment pipeline to enhance the training and competency of FAST operators.
- **Improvement in Clinical Application:** Improve the practicality and applicability of the FAST procedure through the use of CNNs to classify region-specific points of interest and assess operator performance using time-series motion data.

## Expected Outcome

The project aims to make strides towards the development of a fully-fledged, automated skills assessment pipeline for FAST, addressing current challenges in the training and assessment of this procedure.
